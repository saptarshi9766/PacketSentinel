"""
The RAW_TRACEPOINT_PROBE macro provided by BCC simplifies attaching to raw
tracepoints, telling the user space BCC code to automatically attach it to a speci‐
fied tracepoint. Try it in hello-tail.py, like this:
• Replace the definition of the hello() function with RAW_TRACE
POINT_PROBE(sys_enter).
• Remove the explicit attachment call b.attach_raw_tracepoint() from the
Python code.
You should see that BCC automatically creates the attachment and the program
works exactly the same. This is an example of the many convenient macros that
BCC provides.
